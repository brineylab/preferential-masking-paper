The necessary datasets are too large for Github and are uploaded to [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/14019655). 

They will be downloaded into this directory as needed using the code in each of the inference/fine-tuning notebooks in this repo. 

They can also be downloaded by running `./data_download.sh` with the a type `-t` argument (pretraining, test_annotations, pair_classification, CoV_classification) to specify which dataset you would like to download.
