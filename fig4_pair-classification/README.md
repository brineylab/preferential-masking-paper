Run the above notebooks/scripts in numerical order to replicate the native vs shuffled pair classifier analyses in Figure 4.

The fine-tuning script `2-pair_classification-5itr.py` can be run with an associated config file (`C_pair-classification_train-config.yaml` or `D_pair-classification_train-config.yaml`) using DeepSpeed, as described [here](https://github.com/brineylab/deepspeed/tree/main).
