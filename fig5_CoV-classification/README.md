Run the above notebooks/scripts in numerical order to replicate the CoV classifier and AttCAT analyses in Figure 5.

The fine-tuning script `2-CoV_classification-5itr.py` can be run with its associated config file (`CoV-classification_train-config.yaml`) using DeepSpeed, as described [here](https://github.com/brineylab/deepspeed/tree/main).
